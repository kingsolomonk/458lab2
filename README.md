# Question 1
The amount of time I seperated between the two maps was a single day, so quite frankly, I was rather curious if anything would change at all. I wanted to track and filter for the keyword 'NBA' or National Basketball Association, but to my surprise, the crawler does not operate as I thought it would. It seems like even though something does not have anything to do with the NBA, it could be tagged, related to another post, mentioned in a comment, etc with something that has a relation to the TAG/keyword NBA, not the literal text. This showed to me how tricky it gets when handling large amounts of data like so where you don't know between what is relevant or not, especially when it comes to social media. There were some minor findings, but ultimatley, the data one day apart seems to shape out roughly the same areas on the maps.

# Question 2
When it comes to the maps themselves, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference in terms of the geolocational placement of the points. However, something that stood out to me is the volume of tweets. I will delve into this deeper in the next question, but I believe a nation-wide event or holiday was the cause of a slight surge in the amount of active users/posts just a day laterâ€”map 2 has mre concentration of points than map 1 even thuogh roughly the same areas. Although not revealing any difference in geolocational position of the data, there seems to be a geospatial difference in what was going on the two different days.

# Question 3
Now, throughout the entire lab, the most significant element of the two geospatially different time frames was the difference in common words amongst the tweets for each respective day. While the first word cloud was more focused on everyday, daily tasks such as reading, filling gas, dealing with the rain, etc. the second word cloud seemed to have a much more resounding common theme for 4/22/2022: Earth Day. I saw numerous tweets saying Happy Earth Day! in some form or matter which is exactly what made me think the "holiday" is what's behind a huge surge in posts for the same filter keyword, just on different days. Other than that, both word clouds seemed to reference basketball players  plays, or games but one can hardly say the main topic of each crawler output reflects the original keyword of 'NBA'.
